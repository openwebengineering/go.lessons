# Go Lessons

Interested in learning Go, or sharpening your Go skills?  You've come
to the right place!


## What's the big idea?

In short: I give you a program that seems like it should work, and you
find the bug in it, resulting in an "aha!" moment that teaches you
something important about Go.  If you run into trouble, view the hint
associated with that lesson.
